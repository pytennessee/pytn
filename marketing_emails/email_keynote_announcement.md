CFP is Open!
PyTennessee 2018 Call for Proposals is now open.  Do you hear a topic come up often in discussion that could use a presentation; have you learned something the hard way that you wish someone had explained beforehand; do you want to practice your presentation skills?  A yes answer to any of these questions is reason enough to submit a talk.  More importantly, your contribution makes this conference.  Being a part of the community in this way improves the conference.

The proposals will be accepted through November 1.

Note: To submit a proposal, sign up or log in to your account and proceed to your account dashboard!

Thank you,
Chad Upjohn
