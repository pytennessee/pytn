Fellow Pythonistas!
We are thrilled to announce that PyTN 2018 is on its way! The 2018 event will take place on February 10th and 11th, 2018 at the Nashville Law School, and just like previous years, this year's conference will feature keynotes, 3 talk tracks, 1 tutorial track, and a day of Young Coders!

Young Coders
Yes, the Young Coders are back! Tickets for Young Coders are available now, they're limited, and they normally go quickly. The program will once again be led by the inimitable Brad Montgomery. This free program is open to ages 12-17, and all attendees will receive books and a Chromebook they can take home with them!

CFP Opens September 15th!
PyTennessee 2018 is accepting all types of proposals starting Sept 15 (and lasting until November 1, 2017). Due to the competitive nature of the selection process, we encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible. Weâ€™re looking forward to receiving your best proposals for tutorials and talks. Lightning talk sign-ups will be available at the registration desk the day of the event.

Note: To submit a proposal, sign up or log in to your account and proceed to your account dashboard!

Special Sponsorship Profile
Intellovations has been the first sponsor of PyTN for all 5 years we have held the conference, and this year is no exception. In addition to their financial support, they have also provided words of encouragement behind the scenes for all those years as well. They are truly part of the PyTN family, and for that, we greatly appreciate them and are lucky to call them friends.

Final Note
PyTN's goal is to have an open, accepting environment to discuss Python, the programming language. We want you to be a part of this experience and to be a part of achieving this goal. First thing to do is put PyTN 2018 on your calendar. Second thing is to buy your ticket. Third thing is to pass the word about PyTN - twitter handle: @PyTennessee, #pytn, #pytn2018


Thank you,
