We are back!

PyTN is returning February 10th and 11th 2018.  Bill Israel, PyTN Chairman, and his team is extending the success of Jason Myers of previous years.

The goal is to have an open, accepting environment to discuss Python, the programming language.  Bill is nailing down the keynotes which we will announce soon.  Nonetheless, we want you to be a part of this experience and to be a part of achieving this goal.  First thing to do is put PyTN 2018 on your calendar.  Second thing is to buy your ticket.  Third thing is to evangelize - twitter handle: @PyTennessee, #pytn, #pytn2018

## todo: confirm that this is true
Special Sponsorship Profile
Intellovations has been the first sponsor of PyTN for all 5 years we have had the conference, and in addition to their financial support, they have been providing words of encouragement behind the scenes for all those years as well. They are truly part of the PyTN family, and for that, we are greatly appreciative and lucky to call them friends.

## todo: get date for when Poung Coders begin
Young Coders
We will be having young coders again this year. Tickets will be available December 15th at noon and they normally go fast.  The program will be lead by Brad Montgomery, a masterful python teacher, again this year. This free program is open to ages 12-17, and all attendees will receive take home books and a Chromebook.

Personal Note
I add the #blame_chad because I am sure that I will miss something or communication could be better.  In light of this, I want to say thank you to those who have made the Python community so friendly and a place to turn to learn.  Special thanks to Jason Myers for his spirit that he poured into this event.  I jokingly add #blame_chad because of my imposter syndrome tells me that someone else could do this better.  Despite this, it is my hope to give back a bit after the Python community has given me a lot.

Thank you,

Chad Upjohn
