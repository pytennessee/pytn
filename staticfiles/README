This directory is used to store static assets for your project. User media files
(FileFields/ImageFields) are not stored here.

The convention for this directory is:

 * bootstrap/ — a semi-clone of the bootstrap repo
 * symposion/ — symposion specific LESS styles and built css
 
This directory is accessed at /site_media/static/ in runserver when SERVE_MEDIA
is True. It is built with build_static for production environments.
